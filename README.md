# familyface
A way to learn how family is connected.

The server is built for x64 architectures on windows, darwin(mac) and linux. This is an example of how to run it on a mac.

In a terminal start familyface

    ./bin/familyface.darwin

In a different terminal load people into memory, since there is currently no database

    ./populate.sh

Then just go to the page: http://localhost:9090/facebook
